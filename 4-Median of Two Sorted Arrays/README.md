# [4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)
#### Hard

---
- ## Question:
> Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
>
> The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
---
- ## Example:
> Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
>
> Output: 2.00000
>
> Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
